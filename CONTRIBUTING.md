# Enviroment
## Setting up dev enviroment
We use the following packages:
```
distributed_worker
tensorboardx
torch
numpy
```
All other depencies are from the Python 3.5+ standard library.

No packages should be added in any contribution if it can be helped.

# Contibuting
## Reporting a Bug
Reporting a bug can be done through github issues (`https://github.com/ob-trading/portable-es/issues`).
Alternatively issues can be sent to `team+portable-es@onebutton.trade`.

## Code guidelines
* Python code is written with 4 spaces.
* Keep minimal dependencies both internal and external
* No repetitive code if it can be helped (usually it can)

## Submitting patches
Patches can be submitted through github pull requests (`https://github.com/ob-trading/portable-es/pulls`)
Alternatively patchsets can be sent to `team+portable-es@onebutton.trade`; we don't have a mailing-list (yet).

## First contribution
If you are looking the help with the project in general, there are often `TODO` comments in code which are often not too difficult to takle.
We also tag [issues on github](`https://github.com/ob-trading/portable-es/issues`) with `good first issues` if they could be handled by new contributors relatively easily.
